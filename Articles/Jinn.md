## Jinn

Throughout history to the modern day, the existence of separate invisible creations has remained a
captivating, yet accepted part of human thought. In the English language alone, many epithets are
advanced which not only attempt to describe such a creation, but also allude to the manifestation of
such supernatural entities when they seek sentient interaction. Ghosts, genie, ghouls, demons,
apparitions, spirits, are accepted by many cultures and occult arts to cause paranormal activity such
as knocking, pounding, physical attacks and even possession alluding to the accepted interplay at
times between the unseen world and its corporeal counterpart.

From a Quranic perspective, the Arabic word 'Jinn' from its root inherently implies something which
remains hidden, covered or concealed from one's senses.

## THEY SEE YOU FROM WHERE YOU CANNOT SEE THEM


`7:27`

> Ó filhos de Adão, que Satanás não vos seduza, como seduziu vossos pais no Paraíso, fazendo-os sair dele, despojando-os dos seus invólucros (de inocência), para mostrar-lhes as suas vergonhas! Ele e seus asseclas vos espreitam, de onde não os vedes. Sem dúvida que temos designado os demônios como amigos dos incrédulos.


## A CLEAR SEPARATION OF THE TWO CREATIONS

'Al-Naas' (humankind) and 'Al-Jinn' have been clearly distinguished by the Quran as two separate
creations. Nothing portrays this understanding with more clarity than the duality noted throughout
Surah Rahman (Chapter 55).

`55:14` Ele criou o homem da argila pura, como a da cerâmica.

`55:15` E criou os gênios do fogo vivo.

`55:16` – Assim, pois, quais das mercês de vosso Senhor negais(gênios e humanos)?

The Arabic words ‘rabbikuma’ and ‘tukadhiban’ inherently imply duality and underscore the
existence of two separate creations, created from two distinct ways.
